## 📂 Projects
Here are some of the key projects I’ve worked on. Each of these demonstrates my skills in data analysis, visualization, and reporting.

 ### Data Collection with Python ###
   📝 **Description**: This Python program analyzes traveller arrival data to New Zealand from various regions across the months of November to February. Using object-oriented programming, it organizes the data into three classes: Arrival (for monthly data), Region (for a region's data across months), and Continent (for data across multiple regions). The program reads data from text files (e.g., AU_NOV.txt), processes it, and organizes the arrival statistics by region and continent. This project helped me improve my skills in data handling, file processing, and object-oriented design. <br>

🔧 Technologies: Python, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File I/O

 ### Data Analysis & Visualization Project ###   ##infgmt group assignment##
   📝 **Description**: In this Group Project, we analyzed a dataset related to Top Spotify Songs to improve our data analysis and visualization skills. First, we came up with five questions about the data that fit our theme. Then, we used Tableau to create visualizations and a dashboard to answer those questions. After that, we built a prototype website using WIX to present our findings, making sure to apply visual design principles to make it clear and engaging. Finally, we reflected on our website design process and critiqued it based on what we learned about visual design. Overall, this assignment helped us develop skills in data analysis, visualization, and design while working as a team.

   🔧 **Technologies**: Excel, Tableau, Wix, Kaggle
   
 ### Crunching Numbers, Designing Databases, and Predicting the Future of Tech ###  ##infgmt indidiuval assignment##
   📝 **Description**: In this assignment, I worked on three main tasks to develop my skills in data analysis, database design, and technology trends. First, I used spreadsheets to analyze employee data, calculating things like tenure, bonuses, and salaries, and creating pivot tables to explore trends across departments and demographics. Next, I designed a logical Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a healthcare clinic system, making sure to include entities like employees, patients, appointments, and treatment plans. Finally, I researched and wrote about how two emerging technology trends (like AI or IoT) could be applied in an industry of my choice, linking it to competitive strategies. It was a great way to practice data manipulation, database modeling, and strategic thinking!

   🔧 **Technologies**: Excel, ERD

 ### Busan 201: Data managment ###
📝 **Description**: This Data Management class taught me essential skills for handling and organizing data effectively. This class covered structured and unstructured data, relational database modeling, and writing SQL queries, along with Python for data preparation and manipulation. I also gained insights into the ethical and societal challenges of data management. Through hands-on assignments and group projects, I developed critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration skills that will be valuable in my future role as a data analyst.

One of the key assignments I completed in this course involved designing a relational database for a fictitious online web novel platform called NiceReads. The task required me to analyze the platform’s complex data requirements and improve an initial ERD that had been generated using ChatGPT. My role was to identify design flaws, enhance the database structure, and ensure it accurately represented the relationships between users, authors, employees, novels, and transactions. This assignment reinforced my ability to break down complex data problems, apply database design principles, and iteratively refine my work to create a well-structured and functional data model.

   🔧 **Technologies**: Microsoft SQL Server, SQL, ERD Design, Data Modeling

 ### INFOSYS 321: Business Systems Analysis ###
📝 **Description** : In INFOSYS 321: Business Systems Analysis, I developed skills in analyzing and designing business systems to solve real-world problems. This course emphasized hands-on learning, including data modeling, process modeling, and system requirements gathering.

One of the key projects I worked on was analyzing Allbirds, a sustainable footwear company, to understand how they address environmental challenges in the footwear industry. I evaluated their value chain, applied **Porter’s Five Forces** and Generic Strategies, and proposed process improvements like fuel flow meters and cargo monitoring to optimize their operations and reduce their carbon footprint. I also created a vision statement for Allbirds, mapped their business processes, and identified opportunities for cost reduction while maintaining their commitment to sustainability.

Beyond the Allbirds case study, I worked on data analysis and modeling using spreadsheets, created logical ERDs for database design, and explored how emerging technology trends like AI and IoT can transform industries. This course equipped me with the technical and strategic skills needed for roles in business analysis, IT consulting, and system design.

# Upcoming Projects
### Analyzing Airbnb Market Trends
📝 **Description**: I'm currently working on an upcoming project analyzing Airbnb rental data. While reminiscing about my previous holidays and browsing through photos on my camera, I started noticing the price differences between the Airbnb properties I stayed at. This sparked my curiosity about how various factors impact pricing, occupancy, and profitability in the Airbnb market. The project involves exploring various aspects such as pricing trends, occupancy rates, host behavior, and review sentiment analysis. I'll be diving into profitability analysis by identifying the most profitable cities or neighborhoods for Airbnb, examining seasonal pricing strategies, and performing competitor analysis to understand what makes top listings successful. Additionally, I’ll compare short-term and long-term rental strategies, analyze guest reviews for key insights, and develop a dynamic pricing model to optimize nightly rates based on factors like location and market demand.
🔧 Technologies: Excel,Python, SQL, Power BI, Airbnb API (for data collection)
