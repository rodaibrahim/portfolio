## 📊 Projects
Here are **4 KEY** projects I’ve worked on. Each of these demonstrates my skills in data analysis, visualization, and reporting.


### Data Collection with Python
 
📝 **Description**: 

This Python program analyzes traveller arrival data to New Zealand from various regions across the months of November to February.

📋**Steps**:
- Using object-oriented programming, it organizes the data into three classes: Arrival (for monthly data), Region (for a region's data across months), and Continent (for data across multiple regions).
- The program reads data from text files (e.g., AU_NOV.txt), processes it, and organizes the arrival statistics by region and continent.
- This project helped me improve my skills in data handling, file processing, and object-oriented design.

📈 Outcome:
Gained insights into seasonal changes in traveler arrivals, helping to predict future trends for tourism-related businesses in New Zealand. This can assist organizations in better targeting their marketing strategies and optimizing resource allocation.

🔧 **Technologies: Python, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File I/O**

### Data Analysis & Visualization Project 
 
 📝 **Description**:
 
In this Group Project, we analyzed a dataset related to Top Spotify Songs to improve our data analysis and visualization skills. 
 
 📋**Steps**:
- First, we came up with five questions about the data that fit our theme. Then, we used Tableau to create visualizations and a dashboard to answer those questions.
- We then built a prototype website using WIX to present our findings, making sure to apply visual design principles to make it clear and engaging.
-  Finally, we reflected on our website design process and critiqued it based on what we learned about visual design. Overall, this assignment helped us develop skills in data analysis, visualization, and design while working as a team.
-  
📈 Outcome:
The project provided valuable insights into music trends, helping to identify patterns in song popularity and listening behaviors. These insights can be used by marketing teams in the music industry to tailor promotions and increase engagement with their audience.

🔧 **Technologies: Excel, Tableau, Wix, Kaggle**

### SQL & Data Modeling for Business Applications
   
📝 **Description**:  

This project focused on handling and organizing data effectively, with a focus on relational database modeling and SQL queries, alongside Python for data preparation and manipulation. The project also covered the ethical and societal challenges of data management.

📋 **Steps**:  
- Designed a relational database for a fictitious online web novel platform, NiceReads.
- Analyzed the platform's complex data requirements and improved an initial ERD generated using ChatGPT.
- Identified design flaws in the initial database structure and refined it to accurately represent the relationships between users, authors, employees, novels, and transactions.
- Iteratively refined the work to create a well-structured and functional data model.
  
📈 Outcome:
The final data model was used to improve the platform’s database structure, ensuring more efficient data storage, retrieval, and user interaction. This can lead to better system performance and user experience.

### Strategic Data Analysis & Business Process Optimization

📝 **Description**:  

I developed skills in analyzing and designing business systems to solve real-world problems. This project emphasized hands-on learning, including data modeling, process modeling, and determining system requirements.

📋 **Steps**:  
- Analyzed Allbirds, a sustainable footwear company, to understand their approach to addressing environmental challenges in the footwear industry.
- Evaluated Allbirds' value chain and applied **Porter’s Five Forces** and Generic Strategies to assess their market position.
- Proposed process improvements, such as fuel flow meters and cargo monitoring, to optimize operations and reduce their carbon footprint.
- Created a vision statement for Allbirds and mapped their business processes to identify opportunities for cost reduction while maintaining sustainability.
- Conducted data analysis and modeling using spreadsheets, and developed logical ERDs for database design.
- Explored how emerging technology trends like AI and IoT can transform industries.

📈 Outcome:
Provided actionable recommendations for Allbirds to improve their supply chain and reduce costs while enhancing sustainability. This project also demonstrated how emerging technologies could drive industry transformation, helping Allbirds stay competitive in the market.

## 🚀What I'm upto
- I'm working on a project analyzing Airbnb data, focusing on Pricing Trends, Occupancy Rates, Host Behavior, and Review Sentiment Analysis. My interest in this project started when i begin noticing the price differences between the Airbnb properties I stayed at. This sparked my curiosity about how various factors impact pricing, occupancy, and profitability in the Airbnb market.
- I'm also gaining skills through courses like Microsoft Power BI and Data Analysis with Python on Coursera, aiming to get the Power BI certification.
- I’m preparing for my graduation at the end of 2025 from the University of Auckland with a degree in Computer Science and Information Management Technology.
